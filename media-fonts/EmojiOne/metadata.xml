    A color and black and white  emoji SVGinOT font built from EmojiOne artwork
    with support for ZWJ, skin tone diversity and country flags.

    The font works in all operating systems, but will currently only show color
    emoji in Firefox, Thunderbird and other Mozilla Gecko-based applications.
    This is not a limitation of the font, but of the operating systems and
    applications. Regular black and white outline emoji are included for
    backwards/fallback compatibility.
